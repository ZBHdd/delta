/**
 * A base class for implementing a preparation command for removing table features.
 * Must implement a run method. Note, the run method must be implemented in a way that when
 * it finishes, the table does not use the feature that is being removed, and nobody is
 * allowed to start using it again implicitly. One way to achieve this is by
 * disabling the feature on the table before proceeding to the actual removal.
 * See [[RemovableFeature.preDowngradeCommand]].
